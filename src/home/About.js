          Polis Post is an app for campaign organizers. Organizers might be working to educate, empower, and 
          activate citizens, constituents, or the public to persuade decision-makers to take a particular action on public policy matters. 
          One effective tactic for persuading elected officials to take a specific action is through the sharing of constituents'
          testimony through emails to the legislator or their staff. <br/>
